<h2>What is BMI?</h2>

<p>BMI (Body Mass Index) is a simple calculation used to assess whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height.</p>

<p>It is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared.</p>

<h3>BMI Categories</h3>
<ul>
<li>Below 18.5 – Underweight</li>
<li>18.5 to 24.9 – Normal weight</li>
<li>25 to 29.9 – Overweight</li>
<li>30 and above – Obese</li>
</ul>
