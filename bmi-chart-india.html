<h2>BMI Chart for Indian Men and Women (2026 Guide)</h2>

<p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple method used to check whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. In India, maintaining a healthy BMI is especially important due to increasing lifestyle diseases like diabetes, heart problems, and high blood pressure.</p>

<p>BMI is calculated using the formula:</p>

<p><strong>BMI = Weight (kg) / Height (m²)</strong></p>

<p>You can use our free online BMI calculator to check your BMI instantly.</p>

<h3>BMI Categories for Indian Adults</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Below 18.5</strong> – Underweight</li>
<li><strong>18.5 to 22.9</strong> – Normal weight (Healthy range for Indians)</li>
<li><strong>23 to 24.9</strong> – Overweight (At risk)</li>
<li><strong>25 and above</strong> – Obese</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike Western standards, Indian BMI ranges are slightly lower because research shows that Indians have higher body fat percentage at lower BMI levels. This means even small weight gain can increase health risks.</p>

<h3>Why Maintaining Healthy BMI Is Important</h3>

<p>A healthy BMI reduces the risk of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Type 2 Diabetes</li>
<li>Heart Disease</li>
<li>High Blood Pressure</li>
<li>Joint Problems</li>
<li>Fatty Liver</li>
</ul>

<p>Maintaining balanced nutrition, regular physical activity, proper sleep, and stress management are essential for staying within the healthy BMI range.</p>

<h3>How to Improve Your BMI</h3>

<p>If your BMI is above normal range, focus on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reducing processed and fried foods</li>
<li>Increasing vegetables and protein intake</li>
<li>Exercising at least 30 minutes daily</li>
<li>Walking 8,000–10,000 steps per day</li>
<li>Drinking sufficient water</li>
